### How to play the money game

The Money Game is a simple, playful approach to tracking the way you get to a revenue target. 

But instead of tracking revenue, you track the amount of money that you put out in proposals. 

The idea behind it is simple:

You have far more control over the number of proposals you make, than you have over the money people pay you. 

After all, you don't control whether or not someone whips out their wallet. 

But you have a ton more control over their answer, when you ask them if they want to know "how it works" and what it costs to work with you.
 
So, you set a revenue goal and multiply it by three. 

Your job then becomes to put out as much money in proposals, as fast as you can, to reach your target.
