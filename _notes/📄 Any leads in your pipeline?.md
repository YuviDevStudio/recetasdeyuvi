### How often do you ask yourself that?

"Do I have any leads in my pipeline?" 

Because the difference between a coach or consultant who struggles, and one who thrives and lands clients and earns great money, really comes down to one thing:

Working the pipeline. 

As in: a recurring habit of reviewing the people in your world - your leads, or candidates, or prospects - and asking yourself a few simple questions. 

Like: 

"What needs to happen for this deal to close? Or to move forward?"

In an ideal world, each working day, [[üîé Pick a lead, and review where that deal is at|you open up your list of opportunities]] - be it a spreadsheet, or a CRM, or a little black book of names - and you review the people and deals there. 

Then you ask yourself a few simple questions, you take appropriate action, and each day you do the things that keep your deals moving through your pipeline, and your sales closing. 

But it's not an ideal world, and in my speaking with hundreds and hundreds of coaches and consultants over the years, I've found one single recurring flaw that nearly everyone makes:

A reactive, haphazard** way of treating a list of people and opportunities. 

At best, we open our CRM or spreadsheet a few times a month, mostly at a point where we're short on money or sales or leads. 

"Ooh! Business under pressure! Must dive into my CRM!"

Yep. Fat lot of good that does. 

You dive in, you see a bunch of stale deals, a bunch of people who've stopped replying, a couple of micro-managing people and a handful of bargain hunters...

And the next thing you know you're spending the morning on Facebook or LinkedIn, calling it "marketing". 

And this problem - not working a pipeline in a constant, intentional way - is so rampant, it's not even funny. 

I'll bet that you, dear reader, also don't daily check into your pipeline. 

But if you want to generate opportunities, land clients, make money, and have an impact, that's exactly what you should do. 

And to help you with that, that's exactly why SalesFlow Coach exists.
