### How to use SalesFlow Coach
Each day, as early in the day as you can, dive into one of these areas, depending on where you want to start.

**Take some time to reflect: [[‚ùì How is your business doing?]]**

**Goals on track: [[‚ùì How is your money game?]]**

**Work on your sales: [[‚ùì Any deals in the pipeline?]]**


#### Why does SFC work?
The power of SalesFlow Coach is in [[üë®‚Äçüéì How to handle your sales activities|segmenting different types of activity]], and batching them. 

This way, you get to be as efficient and focused as possible, and you remove one of the biggest obstacles to handling and advancing a pipeline: context switching. 

So first you review a lead, then you schedule an activity, and you review another lead. 
  
Only once you're done reviewing, do you move into the next activity block: messaging and outreach and followup. 

So you batch activities by context, and that will make the entire pipeline process much easier, more fun, and more effective. 

Note: while I'm still in Pilot mode, SalesFlow Coach uses the words "leads", "deals", "prospects" etc interchangeably. 

I'll evolve over time, but my basic power has already been built:

**[[‚ùì Any deals in the pipeline?|Advancing deals through your pipeline.]]**
