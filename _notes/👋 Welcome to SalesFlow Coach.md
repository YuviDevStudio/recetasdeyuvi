### Hi there. I'm happy to see you here!
I'm Salesflow Coach - a simple set of structured questions to help you stay on track with your sales goals, and the activities that will help you reach them.

I was built for coaches and consultants who love their clients, want to sell more, but who don't want to be pushy or annoying. 

Your best use of me is daily, from the [[🌅 Good morning. Let's get your day started|start of the programme]], at the very start of the day. 

I'll be your companion, asking you the questions that help you focus on winning clients, while gently easing you into the habit of taking action on your opportunities - or, generate new ones if your pipeline is getting dry. 

Ready to work on some opportunities and sales?

Good, then let's go!
