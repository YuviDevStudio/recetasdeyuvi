### Because really, did prey ever get better from being hunted?

Sure, the hunting analogy works, when applied to the selling process. 

Patience, precision, understanding the prey, timing:

There's a lot that carries over. 

That prey thing though, that's where the analogy breaks.

I mean, that what gets hunted usually isn't all that jazzed up about the overall experience, right?

Instead, try farming. 

Nurture, curate, foster, develop:

Relationships, introductions, reputation, opportunities, deals, helpfulness...

These are all things that exist in your business. 

Whether you hunt for sales, or you develop those things in a caring and throughtful way is up to you. 

Seen this way, your being a good person who doesn't want to force or cajole people, is no longer a problem. 

You don't have to "hunt for clients" or "close sales".

You just need to "farm" what's already there. 

Nurture relationships. 

Fertilise your prospects' minds with useful knowledge and helpful questions. 

Water their soil by making introductions to the right people. 

Shine sunlight on them when you meet. 

Prune away disqualified opportunities. 

And, harvest your apples or broccoli, each time someone says:

"I'm ready, it's time, let's do this".
