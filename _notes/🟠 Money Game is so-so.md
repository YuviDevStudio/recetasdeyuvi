### What to do when your Money Game isn't doing all that well...
First things first: 

The Money Game only works if you actually play it. 

You don't win at chess if you don't actually look at the board and move pieces. 

With the Money Game, it's the same thing. 

Sure, it's nice to decide "I'm going to put out as many proposals as I can!", but if you then don't go in to register how many you put out, and for which amounts, and how many dollars you earned, you're not playing the game. 

So each day, follow these simple steps:
 
First off:
- Look at your money game and review:
	- Number of proposals put out
	- Dollar amount put out in proposals
	- Total revenue earned

Next: 
- Go through your recent conversations and interactions, and update your spreadsheet
  

Finally, ask yourself:
- Which deal or opportunity can I act on - which deal is closest to proposal stage?
- Which deal has a proposal under it, and [[ðŸ”Ž Pick a lead, and review where that deal is at|Which action needs to happen for this deal to close?]]
